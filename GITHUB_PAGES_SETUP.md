# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved
Your GitHub Pages URL (https://praveenkay.github.io/iron-condor-trader/) was showing a blank page because the deployment wasn't properly configured.

## âœ… Solution Implemented
I've created a `docs/` folder with the built application files and pushed them to your repository. Here's what you need to do to activate GitHub Pages:

- Select **"Deploy from a branch"**
- Choose **"main"** branch
- Select **"/docs"** folder (not "/root")
- Click **"Save"**

### 4. Wait for Deployment

- This usually takes 2-5 minutes
